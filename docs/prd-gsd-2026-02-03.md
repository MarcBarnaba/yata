## Document Overview

This Product Requirements Document (PRD) defines the functional and non-functional requirements for GSD, a GTD (Getting Things Done) web application. It serves as the source of truth for what will be built and provides traceability from requirements through implementation.

**Related Documents:**
- Original PRD: `PRD.md`

---

## Executive Summary

GSD is a web application that implements the GTD methodology by David Allen. Unlike a simple todo list, GSD is a decision support system: it captures all inputs, forces clarification through a guided process, organizes actionable items into context-appropriate lists, and supports weekly review to maintain system reliability.

The app targets a single user with local persistence, designed to be fast, minimal, and faithful to the GTD method. The architecture uses an adapter pattern to support a future backend.

---

## Product Goals

### Business Objectives

1. Enable users to reliably empty their mind into a trusted external system
2. Force decision-making at the point of clarification (not at execution time)
3. Ensure the user always works from a list of real, executable next actions

### Success Metrics

1. Inbox zero reachable through guided process
2. Percentage of projects with at least one next action = 100%
3. Number of weekly reviews completed (trend)
4. Capture latency < 2 seconds from intent to saved item

---

## Functional Requirements

Functional Requirements (FRs) define **what** the system does - specific features and behaviors.

Each requirement includes:
- **ID**: Unique identifier (FR-001, FR-002, etc.)
- **Priority**: Must Have / Should Have / Could Have (MoSCoW)
- **Description**: What the system should do
- **Acceptance Criteria**: How to verify it's complete

---

### FR-001: Quick Capture

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**
The user can capture a new item (thought, task, input) into the Inbox at any time. The capture interface must be always accessible from any screen. Only the title is required.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Capture input is accessible from every page
- [ ] Title is the only mandatory field
- [ ] Notes field is optional
- [ ] Item is saved to Inbox immediately on submit
- [ ] Input field clears after capture for rapid successive entries
- [ ] Capture completes in under 2 seconds

**Dependencies:** FR-013

---

### FR-002: Inbox List

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**
Display all items with status "inbox" in chronological order (oldest first). The user can see the count of unprocessed items. The inbox is not an operational list - it is a processing queue.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] All inbox items displayed in FIFO order
- [ ] Item count visible
- [ ] User can select an item to begin processing
- [ ] User can edit item title/notes before processing

**Dependencies:** None

---

### FR-003: Guided Clarify Process

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**
When processing an inbox item, the system presents a guided decision flow:
1. "Is it actionable?" -> If NO: route to Reference, Someday/Maybe, or Trash
2. "Is it a single action?" -> If YES: create Next Action. If NO: create Project + define first Next Action
3. Additional routing: delegate (Waiting For) or schedule (Calendar)

This flow is mandatory - no inbox item can be moved to an operational list without going through clarify.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Step-by-step wizard UI presents one decision at a time
- [ ] "Not actionable" routes to Reference, Someday/Maybe, or Trash
- [ ] "Single action" creates a Next Action with context assignment
- [ ] "Multiple actions" creates a Project and prompts for first Next Action
- [ ] Delegation option creates a Waiting For item with delegatedTo field
- [ ] Calendar option assigns a due date (hard landscape only)
- [ ] Item cannot skip the clarify process

**Dependencies:** FR-002, FR-011

---

**Dependencies:** FR-004

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) define **how** the system performs - quality attributes and constraints.

---

### NFR-001: Performance

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**
The application must be fast and responsive. Quick capture must complete in under 2 seconds. Page transitions must feel instant. Lists with up to 1000 items must render without perceptible lag.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Capture to save < 2 seconds
- [ ] Page transitions < 300ms
- [ ] Lists of 500+ items render in < 1 second

**Rationale:**
Speed is critical for GTD adoption - any friction in capture means the user will stop using the system.

---

### NFR-002: Persistence Architecture

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**
Data layer uses an adapter/repository pattern. MVP uses localStorage or IndexedDB. The interface must be abstract enough to swap in a REST backend without changing store logic.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Persistence adapter interface defined with CRUD operations
- [ ] localStorage/IndexedDB adapter implements the interface
- [ ] Stores depend only on the adapter interface, not the implementation

**Rationale:**
Enables future backend integration and cross-device sync without rewriting business logic.

---

### NFR-003: Responsive Design

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**
The application works well on mobile phones, tablets, and desktop browsers. Balanced responsive design with equal attention to both form factors.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Usable on screens from 320px to 2560px wide
- [ ] Touch-friendly targets (minimum 44px)
- [ ] No horizontal scrolling on any screen size

**Rationale:**
GTD capture happens anywhere - the app must work on the user's phone as well as their desktop.

---

### NFR-004: Browser Support

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**
Supports modern evergreen browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest 2 versions).

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] No polyfills for IE

**Rationale:**
Single-user app with no legacy constraints.

---

### NFR-005: Data Portability

**Priority:** Should Have

**Description:**
All user data can be exported and imported via JSON. Export format is versioned for forward compatibility. Architecture considers future sync scenarios.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] JSON export includes version field
- [ ] Import validates version compatibility
- [ ] Schema documented for external tool integration

**Rationale:**
User data ownership and future sync capability.

---

### NFR-006: Offline Capability

**Priority:** Must Have

**Description:**
The application works fully offline since all data is local. No network requests required for core functionality.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- [ ] App loads and functions without internet connection
- [ ] All CRUD operations work offline
- [ ] No external API calls for MVP features

**Rationale:**
Local-first architecture means offline is the default mode.

---

## Epics

Epics are logical groupings of related functionality that will be broken down into user stories during sprint planning (Phase 4).

Each epic maps to multiple functional requirements and will generate 2-10 stories.

---

### EPIC-001: Capture & Inbox

**Description:**
Quick capture of thoughts/inputs and inbox management. The entry point for all items into the system.

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR-001 (Quick Capture)
- FR-002 (Inbox List)

**Story Count Estimate:** 3-4

**Priority:** Must Have

**Business Value:**
Without reliable capture, the user cannot trust the system. This is the foundation of GTD.

---

### EPIC-002: Clarify (Process Inbox)

**Description:**
The guided decision-making flow that transforms vague inbox items into actionable, organized items. The core intellectual engine of the app.

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR-003 (Guided Clarify Process)

**Story Count Estimate:** 4-6

**Priority:** Must Have

**Business Value:**
This differentiates GSD from a simple todo list. The clarify process forces proper GTD decision-making.

---

### EPIC-003: Organize (Lists & Views)

**Description:**
All the organized lists that the user works from: Next Actions, Projects, Waiting For, Someday/Maybe, Reference, Calendar, and their supporting features.

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR-004 (Next Actions List)
- FR-005 (Projects List)
- FR-006 (Project Detail)
- FR-007 (Waiting For List)
- FR-008 (Someday/Maybe List)
- FR-009 (Reference Archive)
- FR-010 (Calendar View)
- FR-011 (Contexts Management)
- FR-017 (Item Completion)
- FR-018 (Item Trash)
- FR-019 (Project Status Alerts)
- FR-020 (Tags Management)
- FR-021 (Duration Estimates)
- FR-022 (Energy Level)

**Story Count Estimate:** 8-10

**Priority:** Must Have

**Business Value:**
These are the operational lists the user actually works from day-to-day.

---

### EPIC-004: Reflect (Weekly Review)

**Description:**
The guided weekly review process that maintains system reliability and trust.

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR-012 (Weekly Review)

**Story Count Estimate:** 3-4

**Priority:** Must Have

**Business Value:**
Without regular review, the GTD system loses reliability and the user stops trusting it.

---

### EPIC-005: Data & Persistence

**Description:**
Local data persistence, export/import, and the adapter architecture for future backend support.

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR-013 (Local Persistence)
- FR-014 (Export to JSON)
- FR-015 (Import from JSON)

**Story Count Estimate:** 3-5

**Priority:** Must Have

**Business Value:**
Data reliability is non-negotiable. Export/import provides data safety and future portability.

---

### EPIC-006: Dashboard & Navigation

**Description:**
The system overview dashboard and global navigation/settings.

**Functional Requirements:**
- FR-016 (Dashboard)

**Story Count Estimate:** 2-3

**Priority:** Must Have

**Business Value:**
Provides system health overview and quick access to all GTD lists.

---

## User Stories (High-Level)

Detailed user stories will be created during sprint planning (Phase 4).

---

## User Personas

### Primary Persona: Knowledge Worker

- **Name:** Marco
- **Role:** Professional who deals with a constant stream of inputs (emails, meetings, ideas, tasks)
- **Pain:** Mental overload, forgetting commitments, working from vague lists
- **Goal:** A trusted external system where everything is captured, clarified, and organized
- **Technical skill:** Intermediate - comfortable with web apps, not necessarily technical
- **Device usage:** Laptop at work, phone on the go

---

## User Flows

### Flow 1: Capture -> Clarify -> Act

1. User captures an item (quick capture from any screen)
2. User processes inbox (guided clarify flow)
3. Item lands in the appropriate list
4. User works from Next Actions filtered by context

### Flow 2: Weekly Review

1. User opens Weekly Review
2. System guides through each checklist step
3. User processes remaining inbox items
4. User reviews projects, waiting for, someday
5. Checkpoint saved

### Flow 3: Project Management

1. User identifies multi-step outcome during clarify
2. System creates project + first next action
3. User completes actions, defines new next actions
4. Project completed when outcome achieved

---

## Dependencies

### Internal Dependencies

- None (greenfield project)

### External Dependencies

- Nuxt 3 framework
- Vue 3
- Pinia state management
- Tailwind CSS
- TypeScript

---

## Assumptions

1. Single user - no multi-user or sharing features needed
2. Modern browser only - no legacy support required
3. Local-first storage is acceptable for MVP
4. User is familiar with GTD methodology (no in-app tutorial for MVP)
5. No native mobile app needed - responsive web is sufficient

---

## Out of Scope

1. Multi-user support / collaboration
2. Backend server / API (future phase)
3. Native mobile apps (iOS/Android)
4. Email integration / automatic capture
5. In-app GTD tutorial or onboarding
6. Natural language processing for item clarification
7. Recurring tasks
8. Integration with external calendars (Google Calendar, etc.)
9. Push notifications / reminders

---

## Open Questions

1. Should the Calendar view be a full calendar UI or a simple date-sorted list?
2. Should there be a "Review" prompt/notification after 7 days without a weekly review?
3. What is the preferred IndexedDB vs localStorage threshold? (e.g., switch to IndexedDB when > 500 items)
